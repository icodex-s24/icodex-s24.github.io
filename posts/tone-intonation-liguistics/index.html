Here are the key takeaways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Intonation changes meaning</strong>: The same word or phrase can have different meanings depending on the pitch or melody used. For example, “ice cream” can be a question, an excited statement, or a neutral comment based on the intonation applied.</p><li><p><strong>Pitch contours</strong>: Words and phrases can be likened to melodies with high and low pitches. Even though individual voices vary in their natural pitch range, the pitch contour (rising or falling) determines the intonation. For instance, questions in English often rise towards the end, while statements usually fall.</p><li><p><strong>Cultural and linguistic differences</strong>: Some languages use intonation to change meanings at the sentence level (intonation languages), while others, like Mandarin, use tone at the word level (tone languages). Mandarin uses specific tones to differentiate meanings (e.g., the word “ma” can mean mother, hemp, horse, or scold depending on the tone).</p><li><p><strong>Pragmatic effects of intonation</strong>: Intonation can also express emotions like enthusiasm, sarcasm, or uncertainty. For example, “great!” can indicate genuine enthusiasm, while “great…” with a flat tone can convey sarcasm.</p><li><p><strong>Learning through context</strong>: Intonation is often learned through exposure and practice rather than explicit instruction, making it crucial in both acquiring a language and mastering its subtleties.</p></ol><p>In summary, understanding English intonation involves recognizing how shifts in pitch and tone can drastically alter meaning, emotion, and intent in communication.</p><h2 id="transcript"><span class="me-2">Transcript</span><a href="#transcript" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>(128) 79: Tone and Intonation? Tone and Intonation! - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDjdl9XEKAs</p><p>Transcript: (00:01) [Music] L: Welcome to Lingthusiasm,   a podcast that’s enthusiastic about  linguistics! I’m Lauren Gawne.   G: I’m Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we’re  getting enthusiastic about the melodies   of words. But first, our most recent  bonus episode was a recording of our   liveshow with Dr. Kirby Conrod about language  and gender that we held as part of LingFest. (00:37) L: Thanks to all the patrons who attended,  asked excellent questions, and also helped   support us by keeping the show ad-free. G: To get access to this bonus episode and many,   many other bonus episodes to listen  to go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm.   [Music] L:   Hey. G: Hey.   L: Hey? G: Hey!   L: Hey! G:   So, here’s one word, “hey,” and it’s  got a bunch of different vibes depending   on what pitch contour we’re using with it. (01:16) L: We can use those pitch contours with a whole   bunch of different words to give them a different  spin. If we have a word like, “ice cream.”   G: “Ice cream.” L: Oh, very serious. Uh, “Ice cream?”   G: That’s a bit of a question. Ice cream…? L: Ice cream and what?   G: Ice cream and ice cream! L: Perfect choice. “Ice cream!”   G: Very excited ice cream. (01:39) L: We’ve said the word “ice cream”   with a whole bunch of different intonation  that’s given it different meaning. That’s   because we’re making use of the way that we can  change the melody of words that we’re saying.   G: When we talk about the different kinds of  pitches that words can have that change the   meanings they have, I think it’s probably useful  to clarify what we mean by “changing the pitches   of the words” in this particular context. (02:07) It’s  more like playing a word on a different kind of   melody, which might be a very simple melody – it  might just be one or two notes – and that melody   is relative to the highness and lowness, the pitch  of the words that came before it. But it’s not   an absolute melody because that’s just sort of  the range my voice lives in most of the time.   L: And different voices live in different ranges  just like if we visit the woodwind section of a   bunch of instruments, we’ve got small instruments  like a piccolo or a big instrument like an oboe   or a bassoon. They can all play exactly the same  tune; they just play them at a different pitch. (02:41) G: If we’re thinking about something that’s  making a pitch intonation – say something   like question intonation, which is one of  the easiest ones to think about because   it’s got that nice question mark for us to grab  onto – different people saying something with   question intonation is sort of like playing  the same song – you know, “Twinkle, Twinkle   Little Star” or something – on different kinds  of instruments. (02:59) It’s all making that same melody   of going down a bit and then up at the end. L: There’s a lot of different meaning that we   associate socially with different pitches –  so whether someone has a high voice or a low   voice. We played around a lot with this in our  episode on vocal folds and how we have different   associations with different pitches for different  genders. (03:22) In our interview with Nicole Holliday,   she talked about how African American English  has different intonation to Standard American   English and what that says about identity, but  today we’re gonna look at more of the ways that   we can use pitch and melody to change sentences  or words in the way that they have meaning.   G: Right. (03:44) Let’s start with the version of  different pitch melodies that is the most   accessible to English speakers, and that’s the  one that operates on a whole phrase and changes   that meaning in relatively predictable ways  no matter what sort of phrase it applies to.   We have our example from earlier, “Ice cream?  Ice cream. Ice cream! Ice cream. Ice cream.”   L: And in all of those cases,  no matter how you say it,   it still refers to the creamy, frozen desert. G: Right. (04:11) But when we add something like question   intonation or if we add list intonation or  exclamation mark intonation, those change   the ways in which it’s interpreted in this very  predictable way. If we add question intonation to   lots of other words, they all sound question-y.  You can have: “Ice cream? Cake? Pizza? Barbecue?   Umbrella? Clarinet?” L: Oh, okay, that’s not   a “What’s for dinner?” list. G: “Om nom nom, clarinet. (04:36) ”   L: They all end up being questions. G: Right. And you can do this with   longer phrases and sentences to – especially,  there’s subtle differences in different kinds   of questions. L: Okay.   G: I’m gonna say one sentence with two different  versions of question intonation, and I want you to   tell me what you think the meaning difference is. L: Okay. (04:56) G: Number One, “Can you bring cake  or ice cream?”, and Number Two,   “Can you bring CAKE or ice cream?” L: Okay, so the first one, I feel like   it’s much more open to like, you just want  some kind of desert situation. I might turn   up with a trifle, and it’s probably okay. (05:13) G: “Can you bring cake or ice cream?” – yeah,   that’s sort of like a yes-no  question, “Can you do this?”   L: Some kind of desert. G: As a general category.   L: Whereas with the other one, I really feel  like my options to bring are cake or ice cream,   and I have to choose one or the other. G: Right, exactly. In that case, I’m asking   a question about these two alternatives  and getting you to pick one, and actually,   if you were to bring both, maybe that’d be  kind of weird because I’m actually gonna get   someone else to bring the other one. L: Yeah, probably gonna hedge my bets (05:36) and bring an ice cream cake though. G: Ice cream cake is always acceptable.   L: Exactly where you go up in the phrase can  really change the effect that the intonation   has on the sentence. Questions rise up towards the  end, but that’s very different to another type of   rising up which is a phrase specifically known as  a “high-rising terminal” but which you may know as   “uptalk” where that also goes up towards the end,  but the point in the sentence at which it goes   up is a little bit different. So, you can tell  the difference between a question and uptalk. (06:08) G: I think this is particularly interesting  because when it comes to writing people often   use a question mark to indicate both types of  intonation. So, if you’re saying something like,   “Ice cream?” But I think most people can actually  tell the difference. Can I say them both to you   and see which one you think is which? L: Yeah. (06:24) G: Here’s Number One, “There’s some ice cream?”  and Number Two, “There’s some ice cream?”   L: That first one goes up and stays up earlier  and stronger, which sounds much more like uptalk   than a question to me. We use that to indicate  that someone wants to continue saying something.   G: Then in the second one, that’s more of  a question which actually goes down first   and then up towards the end. (06:51) That’s “There’s  some ice cream?” and “There’s some ice cream?”   where I’m deliberately going “ice cream”  – just going straight up over going down   versus up. There’s this difference here, even  though we’re not very precise about writing   these sorts of intonational contours in English.  People tend to use a question mark for both, and   it’s obvious from context. But it’s fascinating  to me that we can actually hear the difference. (07:08) L: When it comes to analysing the difference,  sometimes linguists will literally draw a   little up and down pitch contour over the top of  a sentence to show that the question one does have   that downward before upward movement. G: I love these. I feel like   they’re very old school. L: It’s quite old school. (07:26) You know,   they are somewhat subjective, but they do show  you the difference between the two patterns.   G: I love this style. I think it’s really quite  easy to read. You often see them in typewritten   manuscripts because it’s a little bit hard to do  digitally, but it’s sort of easy to just draw with   a pen. I find it quite easy and intuitive  to read. (07:43) Unfortunately, it’s a little bit   harder to do things like technical comparison with  because you’re drawing this very analogue curve,   and then you’re looking at another sentence  and being like, “Okay, is that the exact same   shape that this person drew? Or did this  little dip – was that just like their hand   got jogged or did they mean something by it?” L: Other systems involve using notation, like   you might use “H” for the bit that’s high and “L”  for the bit that’s low. (08:03) I’ve seen other notation   systems that use arrows as well to indicate those  upward and downward movements in the melody.   G: Yeah, the H and L one I feel like is relatively  intuitive, although when you start combining it,   it can get quite complicated. I’ve also seen  people use numbering systems where you number   pitches from one to four. (08:23) The problem with this  for me is that some people prefer a version where   “one” is low and “four” is high, and some systems  do the exact opposite thing, so when I see pitch   numbers, I never quite know what’s going on. L: Always worth checking what their transcription   system is before getting into things is a thing  I’ve learnt when it comes to number systems.   G: Absolutely. (08:41) I think that pitch systems  are something where they’ve been one of the   hardest things for me to learn at a technical  level because when it comes to something like,   “Okay, here’s some sounds. We’re gonna produce  them. We’re gonna transcribe them. We’re gonna   write down a bunch of symbols for them,” that’s  something that I was able to learn in a relatively   concrete way. (08:59) But pitch is this thing that’s  overlaid on top of the individual sounds and   applies to the whole syllable or to the whole  word or the whole sentence and has taken me   quite a while to be able to train my ear to hear  rather than just perceiving the sentence as like,   “This is a question,” or “This is angry,” or  “This is curious,” or something like that.   L: I think it takes practice to step away  because it is something that is often used   for that kind of emotional and stylistic effect,  so it can be harder to step back and think about   what’s actually being done with intonation versus  other things that we use strategically to create (09:29) emotion in the way that we speak. G: I feel like I’m better at it now than   I used to be. I’m still not as good as somebody  who does this full time, but it is something   you can improve at with practice, for sure. L: Absolutely. I think the more you realise   just how much it is dependent on the specific  language, it can help you think a little bit   about what’s happening with intonation. (09:53) A  thing like having rising intonation at the   end of a question where it goes up is not  something that happens in all languages.   G: I mean, I was calling this “question”  intonation, but does every language ask   questions by doing this low and then high thing? L: A lot of languages do, but that doesn’t mean   that it’s all languages do it. (10:10) Hawaiian is a language that has   falling question intonation, as an example. G: This is the Indigenous language of Hawai’i?   L: Yeah. And what’s really interesting is that  the Hawaiian creole that has arisen because of the   contact between Hawaiian and English has actually  continued to use that falling question intonation   instead of English rising question intonation. G: Oh, that’s really neat. (10:29) That’s something that’s   gotten passed on in the creole as well. L: Yeah.   G: Question intonation is easy to talk about, but  there’re also other things that pitch is doing.   I think one of my favourites is using pitch  to indicate things like attitude. A word like   “great” – you could say something like, “Great.” L: Okay. (10:46) G: “Great!” L: Oh, much better.   G: “Great…” L: Oh,   no need to be sarcastic. G: So, that’s “Great. Great!   Great…” It’s sort of starting medium and dropping  to low – “Great.” Enthusiasm with the pitch   starting very high and ending low – “Great!” Or  sarcasm which starts and ends low – “Great…”   L: It just stays low. (11:12) G: I’m picturing a teenager   very sulkily in the corner – “Great…” L: Same word. The intonation gives it very   different meanings. G: Absolutely.   L: And a lot of those meanings are conveyed  by the English writing system in traditional   writing systems, and it’s part of what I love  about how you analyse how people are playing   with new internet grammar and using all kinds of  different techniques with the writing system to   try and capture some of that spoken vibe. (11:37) G: This is something that I talked about a   lot in Because Internet, but there’s also  a Tumblr post that I think very succinctly   summarises it in which the first poster  says, “Part of the New Internet Grammar:   using question marks not to denote questions, but  upturns in voice, so that a tentative statement   gets a question mark but a flatly delivered  question doesn’t. (11:54) ” And then someone comes along,   and I think very tongue-in-cheek  says, all lowercase, no punctuation –   L: “why would you do this”. G: The first person again, “It just seems   right?” – question mark. I think we’re evolving  more subtle ways of indicating intonation like   this, including things like deadpan questions  or tentative statements, but it’s something   that’s kind of a work-in-progress in English,  which is a nifty thing to keep observing. (12:18) L: You can also use intonation for emphasis. So,  where you chose to create a rise in the sentence   can indicate that something is prominent. G: Yeah. If you’re looking in the freezer or   something, and you’re making a list of what’s in  there, you might end up with “ice CREAM” and “ice   CUBES” even though normally you would say them  as “ice cream” and “ice cubes” because they’ve   both got “ice” in it, you wanna stress the  other part – the “cream” and the “cubes” – to   differentiate between them a little bit more.  But intonation isn’t the only way that languages (12:47) can emphasise different parts of a sentence. I  feel like I had to learn how to do this a bit   differently when I was getting more comfortable  speaking French because, in English, we have   this strong tendency to use this pitch part and  also loudness and things like that to emphasise   certain words. (13:06) If you’re in an ice cream place,  and it’s kind of loud, you might emphasise like,   “Can I get TWO SCOOPS of the CHOCOLATE ice cream  in a CONE, please?” to make each of those parts   more distinct. But I feel like French is a bit  more likely to use word order in terms of which   part you say first rather than saying particular  parts in a more emphatic way. That hasn’t been as   effective for me when I’m speaking French. L: Interesting. (13:28) And it’s a good reminder   that when you’re learning a language, you  often don’t overtly get taught how to use   intonation. It’s something that you pick up from  listening experiments and talking to people and   listening to people and trying to imitate them. G: Absolutely. Sometimes, it’s easy to imitate   in the sense that when people are doing mock  versions of an accent, the intonation contours,   the characteristic intonation contours, are some  of the things that come really early. (13:53) But I feel   like it’s also worth noting that sometimes  what’s a characteristic intonation contour –   just sort of a default one in one language –  might be something that carries an emotional   meaning in another language. I guess you wanna be  cautious when you’re reading someone’s intonation   as hostile or as overly friendly that this  might be a relatively baseline thing for them,   and it’s not that people are secretly hating you. (14:20) L: If someone’s language doesn’t have a rise at   the end of a question, it might come across as a  hostile question, but it’s actually just the way   they’re used to asking questions. G: Yeah, it’s something that’s   worth keeping in mind. L: So far, we’ve looked at how we can   use pitch to change the meanings of full phrases  or sentences, but we can also use changes in pitch   to change the meanings of specific words. G: Right. (14:40) This is less of   “ice-cream-question-mark” versus “ice-cream-yay”  or “ice-cream-sarcastic” and more like   “ice cream” versus “doorknob” or  something completely different.   L: Or famously in Mandarin, the difference  in tone creates a difference between the   word “mother” and “horse” but also the  words “hemp” and “scold,” which are all   part of the four-tone system in Mandarin. (15:02) G: They’re all based on “ma” pronounced   with different tones. You have the  word for “mother” which is “mā.”   L: That’s high level. G: “Mā.” The word for “hemp” which is “má.”   L: That’s a rising tone. G: “Má.” The word for “horse” which is “mǎ.”   L: That’s falling with a  bit of a rise at the end.   G: “Mǎ.” And the word for  “scold,” which is “mà. (15:23) ”   L: Which is just directly falling. G: “Mà.” There are four tones in Mandarin.   For the particular syllable “ma,” each of them  corresponds to a word. But you could have other   syllables where there happens to be a gap, and in  this particular tone combined with this particular   syllable, there isn’t a word that corresponds  to that gap, whereas you don’t have something   like in English, “Oh, we just never say this word  with question intonation. (15:48) You can’t question this   word. No one ever questions peanuts.  They just don’t get questioned.”   L: Because the tone is so integral to the  meaning of the word, tone is often much more   likely to be expressed in the writing system  if a language does have a writing system.   G: Both the Mandarin-type thing where the  tone changes the meaning of the word and   the English-type thing where the tone affects the  meaning of the whole phrase, they’re both drawing   on a similar resource at the acoustic level in  terms of how the pitch melody changes as you’re (16:22) producing the thing. But because they have such  different functions in terms of language, they get   referred to by different names. The English one  is “intonation,” and the Mandarin one is “tone.”   These are both words that crop up sometimes  used a bit more loosely, but in the technical   linguistic sense, “tone” is when the meaning  of the word itself changes, and “intonation” is   when the broader meaning of the word as it fits  into the phrase or into the discourse changes. (16:50) L: As far as we know, every spoken language  makes use of intonation. Tone is actually   pretty prevalent. There’re some estimates  that 60-70% of the world’s languages do   have this word meaning-changing tone function  to some extent; it’s just that a lot of these   languages are those languages with really small  populations that you hear less about, and they’re   concentrated outside of the Indo-European family. (17:18) G: With the notable exception of Mandarin and   other Chinese languages – all of which, I think,  have tone – which are not small languages.   L: There’re definitely many large languages  like Vietnamese and Hmong as well as, you said,   the Chinese languages that have tone that are  national languages – very visible – but also many,   many of the world’s smaller languages also  have tone systems of some type or another. (17:38) G: But because all languages make use of  intonation somehow, if you’re not already   familiar with a tone language, and you’re  trying to learn one, sometimes people draw   on the intonation resources by writing Mandarin  tones using question marks and exclamation marks   and things like that as a cue to bridge you  over to using it for tone purposes. (17:56) This can   be pretty effective at a learning level. L: Huh, yeah, I could see how that would   be useful. So, for that second tone, which is  rising, you could map that onto your understanding   of question intonation, which is also rising. G: Exactly. This can be, sometimes, a notation   thing that people can use to take notes with and  help remember how to pronounce it. (18:13) I find, for me,   I haven’t really tried to learn Chinese, but I’ve  been exposed to enough of the same “ma” example   that shows up in linguistics a lot that I can now  hear it and reproduce it immediately after someone   has produced it, but I have a hard time retaining  it in my long-term memory which tone a particular   word has just because this is not something  that I’m in the habit of paying attention to. (18:33) But people do learn tone languages in adulthood.  It’s a thing that’s possible. I just haven’t put   enough effort into it. L: Confessions.   G: Like, there’re a lot of languages.  I’d like to learn them all, but you know,   so many languages, so little time. L: Beyond using your English punctuation   hack to correlate to different tones, there  are a variety of ways of writing especially the   Mandarin tone system – especially if you’re using  a Roman orthography. (19:01) Some of those have been taken   up more than others across different systems. G: I think the most common way that people write   tones in Mandarin these days is just using  accent marks or diacritics on the vowels.   You can have the “mā” tone being written with a  flatline above the vowel. And then you can have   an upwards-pointing line and a downwards-pointing  line, and something that points down and then up,   to match the shape of the tones. (19:24) L: I think it’s become a lot easier to   use these diacritics above the vowel for the  tone with modern computer systems. I’m very   grateful that we have those to make that kind of  writing system easier. But there have been some   other fun proposals over the years as well. G: I am particularly fond of a proposal not   necessarily for its practical benefit but for  its interesting-ness called “Gwoyeu Romatzyh” –   hope I’m pronouncing that right. (19:52) This is  a romanisation system that’s based on,   okay, what if we just spelled each of the  tones differently using Roman letters.   L: Okay, so you spell the vowel part,  which is where we hear the tone,   differently depending on what the tone is? G: Yeah. For example, what if you doubled the   vowel – you know, instead of “A,” you wrote  “AA” – to indicate one variant of tone. (20:14) Or   what if you put a silent R, that would be in your  variety of English, after some vowels to indicate   another kind of tone. Or what if you changed  – instead of writing “NG” you wrote “NQ” and   that was another way of writing a tone.  And you would know based on the spelling,   “Actually, this is different tones. (20:35) ” L: I’ve definitely seen Q used at the   end of words as a silent – it’s not a letter, it’s  just indicating that it’s a particular kind of low   or falling tone in other languages where it was  before the magic of easy computer writing systems   and people were typing thing up on typewriters. (20:52) I didn’t realise that they’ve probably got that   from this older Chinese system. How interesting. G: This is a system that was invented by this   very, very cool Chinese linguist in history  named Zhao Yuanren, who’s my favourite guy.   L: I know Zhao from another way of transcribing  Chinese tones. I didn’t realise he’d come up   with all these different ways. “Zhao numbers” are  where you use a set of numbers to indicate tone. (21:18) I like this one because it gives you a little  bit of information about what’s happening with   the acoustics. You have the numbers one to five  – “one” being the lowest range in the melody that   people are using and “five” being the highest.  Because these Mandarin have contours and movement,   so you’re falling tone is “51” because it’s  going from the highest to the lowest point,   your rising tone is “35” because  it’s rising, but the rise is less   than that full fall on the falling tone. G: That’s a really elegant system because (21:50) it can also work for other languages beyond  just Mandarin. You could use it to describe,   in principle, any tone system as long as it’s  either flat or just doing one transition. I guess   you could put three numbers beside each other if  you wanted to do rising-falling-rising-again.   L: Definitely a lot less opaque than the changing  the way you spell the vowels in a word, which is   probably why it stayed around a bit longer. (22:15) G: But also, not necessarily the most practical   thing because typing numbers every time you  type a vowel so you can indicate what tones   it has might get kind of tedious. L: Especially because they are   written superscript, which is  often quite annoying to type.   G: Especially on computers. (22:32) I just love that  both of these systems are by the same guy, Zhao,   who is also the guy that came up with the famous  Chinese sentence that illustrates the necessity   of writing tone in Chinese – he had some themes –  which is the tongue-twister sentence that’s about   the lion-eating poet in the stone den. L: Ooo, this is the one where it’s the   same consonants and vowels and the only  thing that changes is the tone, right?   G: Yeah, it’s just all versions of “shi” with  different tones. (22:57) If you write with without the   tones, it’s just “shi shi shi shi shi,” and I’m  not gonna go it justice by saying it out loud,   but we are linking to a recording. It’s a really  good demonstration of the necessity for one out of   the many competing systems that he invented. L: It’s worth just saying that the Chinese   writing system is such that because each word  has its own character, the characters are all   sufficiently different. They’re not based on  the consonants and vowels. (23:23) So, you memorise   the character including its tone information.  This is just something we’ve had to solve for   more phonetic writing systems like English. G: Right. And for trying to transliterate Chinese   into Roman characters, which is sort of the  project – he was involved with a lot of the early   Romanisations in the 1930s and trying to figure  out how to go about doing that. (23:41) The neat thing   about this poem is that it reads differently  in different Chinese varieties. In Classical   Chinese and in the writing system, it’s coherent.  In Mandarin, it’s just four syllables because   Mandarin’s just got four tones. But in Cantonese  or Hokkien, it’s got 22 syllables or 15 syllables   because these varieties have more tones. (24:05) L: Another tone language that went through   a Romanisation process but took a different  approach to writing systems was Vietnamese,   which has six tones. Vietnamese has also  gone with this diacritic approach where you   put little additional bits of information  above or below the vowel, but it’s taken   a very different approach to Mandarin. (24:27) G: I’ve seen Vietnamese on signs or on menus   and things like that, and it’s really distinctive  for having that little curved diacritic on the   top of some of the vowels. It looks like a little  backwards C or a hook. For example, in a word like   “phở,” which is a delicious noodle dish, you see  the curve at the top. (24:44) What I didn’t realise until   we were doing research for this episode was that  this is actually from the interrogative question   mark because Vietnamese had a lot of contact  with French, which also uses question marks   to indicate a rising intonation, and so this  indicates a rising intonation because it was   originally modelled after a question mark. They  just made it really tiny and put it on the vowel. (25:03) L: Huh! G: Isn’t that cute?   L: I’m used to diacritics that have a little  rising bit because the intonation goes up,   but I didn’t realise that this was directly  inspired by the rising intonation of the   question mark. G: Yeah!   L: That’s a good story. G: You’ve worked on Tibetan   languages, right? There’s tone in those? L: There is tone in Tibetan languages. (25:25) Yolmo and   Syuba, the languages I work with, have a two-tone  system which only happens with some combinations   of sounds. For sounds like /ma/ you can have  “má” and “mà,” or a sound like /tə/, you can   have “tó,” which is “rice,” and “tò,” which is  “stone.” But there’re some sounds – like if you   have a /kə/, there’s only ever a high tone.  Like, “ká” is the word for “mouth. (25:55) ” If you   have a sound like /gə/, you’ll only ever have a  low tone. The tone isn’t for every combination   of sounds. It is depending on the environment  of the consonants that it’s hanging out with.   G: How do people go about writing that? L: The languages I work with have taken the   Nepali writing system, which was designed for  Indo-Aryan languages but maps pretty well to   their sound system, and they often include a H to  indicate low tone because that low tone is kind of   breathy. They have a silent H there. G: The “H” is not for “high”; (26:27) it’s for the breathy low tone. L: Yeah. Just to be non-English about it. That   word “stone” would be T-O-H in English orthography  and using the H character in Devanagari as well.   G: Not that far off one of  Zhao’s proposals, in fact.   L: Not that far off one of Zhao’s proposals except  that I think the Q was somewhat arbitrary, and the   H does correlate with this kind of /h/ vibe to the  vowel that the low tone brings. (26:56) But for Tibetan   languages that are written with the Tibetan  script, what’s really interesting is the script   doesn’t have anything about tone because it was in  existence before the language developed tone. It’s   something that can come about in a language. G: So, the script is older than   tone in the language itself. L: Yeah. (27:15) And so, you tend to know   what words have high or low tone because it’s that  same kind of environment factor if it’s something   that is more likely to have a high tone or a low  tone. But it’s done with these very elaborate   consonant clusters, which used to be pronounced  and now aren’t and have become the tone system.   G: Sometimes, you get a silent letter like E  that used to be pronounced, and at the time,   it cued sound changes in the words. (27:42) So,  if you have something like “mat” versus   “mate,” the E in “mate” would at one point  have cued the vowel to be different. Now,   even though that letter is silent, it still cues  the same sort of sound changes that it used to.   L: Except that it’s just doing it with  tone in Tibetan. You have this nice   little time capsule of how the language  has changed sounds but still allows you   to read tone into the language as well. (28:08) G: One of the ways of writing tones that   I think is super interesting that we’ve  talked about on the podcast a little bit   before – just switching continents a little  bit from Asia to Mexico – is in Chatino,   which was in our interview with Hilaria Cruz,  which we’ll link to, they’ve got either 14 or   11 tones depending on what you’re counting. (28:29) In  either case, that’s too much to use a diacritic   accent mark-based system because that’s a lot of  teeny-tiny accent marks. It’s also kind of a lot   to use a numerical-based system because that’s  more than nine or ten numerals to put at the   end of your syllables. Instead, they use super  script letters to indicate the different tones.   L: That’s a good solution. (28:51) G: They have super script A, B,   C and so on to indicate the different tones that  are relevant for Chatino. Sometimes, they’re just   written in all caps at the end of the word if the  computer doesn’t support super scripts. These can   convey the tones that they’re using. L: While we’re in the region, Zapotec   is another language that has tone. It uses  tone for something more grammatical. (29:11) So far,   we’ve been talking about how we change between  words like “mother” and “horse,” or “stone”   and “rice.” They’re completely different words  that are unrelated to each other. In Zapotec,   you can use three different tones to create  differences in the grammar of the language.   G: The difference between “I will write” and  “You will write” – there’s a suffix that’s   added on to mean “I. (29:37) ” And then a high tone  also gets added near the beginning of the   word to go with that suffix which indicates  I’m doing it as opposed to you’re doing it.   L: This use of tone for grammatical things like  tense or negation is also incredibly common across   Central and Southern African languages as well. G: There’s an example from Dinka, which   is a language spoken in Sudan, where the tone  is the thing that makes a difference between the   meanings of the following four sentences. (30:06) One  is “I hate Acol,” which looks like a person’s   name. Two is “Acol has been hated.” L: So, we’re moving who is doing the   hating and making it a passive. G: Right. Or “You hate Acol” –   also yet another tone. L: Changing it from “I” to   “you,” so changing the subject. G: And then “Acol is hated.”   L: Oh, the present passive as opposed to past   passive. I feel really sorry for Acol. G: Yeah, I dunno who Acol is. (30:27) I don’t know   why they keep showing up in these examples  sentences and why people hate them so much,   but grammatically it’s very interesting. L: Indeed. The only thing that’s changing is   the tone on the verb “hate,” and that’s  creating different forms of the verb.   G: It’s doing a lot of really interesting  grammatical things in terms of changing   important parts of the meaning. (30:49) The  use of tone for grammatical purposes,   like changing it from “I do something” to “This  has been done” or changing something from “I   did it” to “You did it,” this gets lumped in  together with tone in general – the use of tone   to distinguish between one word and another  word. I think that’s just because languages   that use tone for grammatical purposes also use  it to distinguish between individual words. (31:08) L: There’s an incredibly wide range of ways in  which especially languages like Dinka can use   tone for a whole heap of different grammatical  functions and word-changing functions.   G: That brings us to “Okay, if the majority  of the world’s languages have tone, and all   the world’s languages have intonation, what  happens when you’re trying to do something like,   say, ask a question, which often comes with a  characteristic intonation, and also your language   has individual tones on the individual words?” L: The answer is: it depends on how the tone (31:39) system works, and how that comes  together with intonation. Let’s look   at some contrasting examples to simplify it. G: You mean we’re not gonna run through every   single language in the world and exactly how  its tone and intonation systems work together?   L: Well, I’ve only researched one.  I’m gonna start with that one. (31:57) G: All right. Well, tell us about that one. L: This is one of those “I kind of messed   something up and it turned out to be for the  best” stories. We wanted to collect some tone   data for Syuba, and so I asked some speakers to  read out some word lists. I thought I was trying   to be pretty good at preventing them from doing  list intonation because that would get in the   way of the tones. But for one or two speakers,  we really didn’t do as good a job. (32:22) It’s very   hard when you’re recording long lists and it’s  been long days. We had one or two speakers where   there was this really strong list intonation. G: In English, list intonation would be something   like if you’re reading “Apples, bananas, oranges,  ice cream, cake,” and each of those words is like,   “There’s another word in this list.” L: Yes. (32:41) You have this little rise at   the end. That’s what I was getting in these  recordings. But it turned out to be really   useful because it showed us that intonation  overruled tone in Syuba for speakers.   That’s not a problem because there are only two  tones. Not all words have a contrasting tone   pair. Tone is not doing as much heavy work in  meaning, and intonation can take over from it. (33:07) G: Sometimes, when you have a language with more  tones, the tone and intonation interact with each   other. Say you’re trying to put higher intonation  at the end of a sentence for a question. That   might just make every tone a little bit  higher compared to what it would’ve been   if it wasn’t a question. You can still hear that  the tones are doing slightly different things. (33:25) L: You see this with musical pitch as well. How a  language is sung, the tone system might – again,   with Syuba, speakers are very happy to just  make the words fit into a melody because the   melody of the music is more important – and not  that there’re many songs about stones and rice,   but if you were singing a song, you’d  probably know if someone was talking   about rice or talking about stones. You don’t  need the tone to give you that information. (33:52) G: Ooo, can I talk about my  favourite example of this?   L: Sure. G: This is a difference   between Mandarin and Cantonese. L: Okay.   G: Both of which have tones, but Mandarin has  four and Cantonese has six or nine depending   on how you count. (34:11) In Mandarin, it’s long been  customary in music to not really pay attention   to the relationship of tone and meaning,  and context is just enough to fill it in.   L: A bit like Yolmo and Syuba. G: Yeah, whereas in Cantonese,   there’s a long history in Cantonese opera,  which is carried into Cantonese pop,   of matching the tones to the notes. (34:28) L: Again, that makes complete sense   if that’s the priority your language has. G: Right. This is largely relative, at least in   pop songs. If the next note in the song is lower  in pitch, then you want the word to be lower in   tone. Or if it’s rising in pitch, you want it  to be higher in tone – the next word – and just   sort of continue along that melody. (34:50) But this comes  into problems if you’re trying to translate songs,   and you’ve already got a melody, and you’ve  already got a sense of what the word meaning you   want is. If you are, for example – and this has  happened – a Christian missionary going to China   translating the meanings, the lyrics to hymns – L: Hymns that have existing melodies already   that you probably don’t wanna change. (35:12) G: Nope, that you probably don’t wanna change,   and you have a general vibe to the words already  that you’re not super keen on changing either,   you can end up with really funny things because  if the tone mismatches, people interpret the words   as something different. The example that I have  is a hymn that was intending to say, “I am the   sheep of the lord,” turned into something  that sounded like, “I am a pig’s face. (35:33) ”   L: Not quite the same vibe. G: No. Because apparently   “lord” and “pig” are the same syllables,  the same consonant-vowel combination,   but with different tones on  them. So, this is a confusion   that comes up maybe kind of a lot. L: A very good lesson for those working   with tone languages doing translation. (35:56) G: Make sure to do cultural consultation   if you wanna translate song lyrics. L: Throughout this whole episode,   we’ve been talking about high and low tone and  giving examples and mapping that onto ways of   talking about sound that we’re used to from music  and from melody, but it’s worth just saying very   briefly that this is a cultural metaphor that  we have when we’re talking about sounds. (36:17) G: Oh, yeah, I guess it is. L: Going back to our interview with   Professor Suzy Styles about how we think about  physically abstract things like sounds in terms of   spatial realities and using highness and lowness  as a metaphor. It’s not the only metaphor.   G: What other metaphors do  different cultures use?   L: There’s a metaphor in Farsi for pitch  where you have “thin” or “thick. (36:41) ”   G: Can I guess which one’s thin and which one’s  thick to see if it maps cross-culturally?   L: Have a go. G: All right. I’m gonna say that high notes are   “thin” notes and low notes are “thick” notes? L: Yeah.   G: Excellent. L: But “thin” and “thick” is their default   way of talking about it. There’re probably plenty  of other metaphors cross-culturally. (36:59) In fact,   when I was learning to listen to tone in Syuba,  I would talk to people about “high” and “low.”   But one day we got ourselves into terrible  confusion when I was working with one person   because we were both using “high” and “low,”  but I was using it in terms of musical pitch,   and he was using it in terms of social status  where what I thought of as “high” and “small”   and “thin,” he was thinking of “small and thin and  therefore socially inferior compared to someone   who was big and round and rich.” G: Sitting up on a big chair. (37:29) L: Yes. So, low tone was very solid  and social status and had authority,   and we were using opposite high-low metaphors.  I was using a spatial one; he was using a   social status one. We ended up coming up with an  agreement where we would just talk about whether   it was the “rice” tone or the “stone” tone. (37:53) G: Perhaps something that doesn’t necessarily   translate cross-culturally as much but  definitely a practical solution at the time.   L: Side-stepping any cultural metaphors  that either of us were using.   G: That’s great. L: I like it because it explains this   confusion that we both talked about earlier on  about whether one was a high tone or a low tone. (38:09) It depends on whether you’re thinking of one as  solitary and small, tiny unit, and therefore high,   or if you’re thinking about it as big and grand. G: Sort of the baseline that other things build up   from or something like that. L: Yeah.   G: Going back to our metaphor of playing the same  melody on a small instrument, like a piccolo,   or a large instrument like an oboe, maybe  we could also talk about “small” tone versus   “large” tone. We could even see how many possible  different tone metaphors we can come up with. (38:38) L: I think there’s still a lot that we can  learn across different languages for how they   think and talk about tone and intonation. G: We could try to make a list of how many   different possible tone and intonation  metaphors we can come up with.   [Music] G:   For more Lingthusiasm and links to all  the things mentioned in this episode,   go to lingthusiasm.com.
